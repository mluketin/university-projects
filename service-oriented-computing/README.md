RestWebServiceProject:

Task for this laboratory exercise/project was to create:
- REST interface
- documentation for REST interface
- user authentification
- automatic testing
- log

Rich UI, database, admin interface is not required.

Service must have TWO group of resources that map to URL-s.
My project has books and users.

For each resource, implement all CRUD methods and protect with authentification.
